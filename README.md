## My Opinion
-  Actually the Good Results can't be called cartoon style. Exactly it is close to drawing or painting. It is accepted that the cartoon is a kind of drawings or paintings. Good Results can be called cartoon. Becausee Good Results brings out the origine features (color, divisions) well but Bad Results can't.
-  I think my program need to render stronger edge and clear, vivid and saturated color.
